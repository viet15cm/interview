# Interview-Test

## General requirements Books API:

• The API can be written in either Java or C#

• The API should always return a collection of books in json format.

• By default, it should return all books without any specific sorting.

• If a specific field is searched it should return the result sorted on that field.

• It should be possible to search on any field.

• When creating a new book, use the same ID standard as the rest of the books

## C# requirements:

• The API should be written in .NET > 5.0

• Feel free to use the API template in Visual Studio 2022

---

Whatever field I ask for, it should return the result sorted by that field.
I should be able to ask for an author, a title, a genre, or a description. It should perform the search
"case insensitive" and with partial strings. So, if I ask for "/api/books/author/kim" it should return
only the book by "Ralls, Kim".
I should be able to ask for a price range or a specific price.
I should be able to ask for published_date or part of it, that means all books, books from a certain
year, books from a certain year-month or books from a certain year-month-day.
I should be able to edit any field for any book using the book ID as a search parameter.
I should be able to create a new book.
Use case examples:

## Hints:

Divide the solution into what you think is architectural suitable parts.
Refactor the code to make it as easy as possible to read and maintain.
Use coding techniques like well-known patterns and practices and naming conventions.
Make use of abstractions, dependency injections, extensions, expressions, attributes etc.
Make use of different routes in the controller.
If you are familiar with testing, we would really like to see some unit tests :)
Don't worry if you think it seems like a tough test! Just do your best. If the requirements and use
cases are covered, you are safe. The rest is only to judge the maturity of your skills.
